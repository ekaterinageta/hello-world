# hello-world

My journey on the code path started in 2016 when I decided to spend my vacations in the french coding school - 42. 
This was so far my longest experience with code apart from HLML, and from now on I'm planning to turn it into a less intense but more steady path by getting to know the GitHub. The green squares hunter is born :)
